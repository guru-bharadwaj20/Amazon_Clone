# Amazon_Clone
This webpage is cloned only using HTML &amp; CSS. The goal of this project was to replicate the structure, design, and functionality of Amazon’s early webpage while strengthening my front-end development skills, particularly in HTML layout and CSS styling.

Project Overview:
The clone closely mimics the original Amazon homepage layout, from the header and navigation bar to product categories, search functionality, and footer. This project allows me to demonstrate proficiency in core web development concepts while highlighting attention to detail in design and layout. It’s a great showcase of my understanding of web page structure, styling consistency, and responsive design.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The clone is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that the layout remains functional and visually appealing across a wide range of devices.
Exact Layout Replication: The webpage replicates Amazon’s original structure, with attention to the arrangement of product images, navigation menus, and footer sections. It provides a solid representation of the early Amazon design, with a focus on accurate spacing, alignment, and element placement.
User-Focused Interface: The layout emphasizes usability, ensuring easy navigation and an intuitive user interface. The design features clearly separated sections, making it simple for users to browse products, search for items, and navigate through various categories.
Modern CSS Techniques: This project leverages modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid to create flexible, fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. The use of these techniques ensures proper alignment, spacing, and responsiveness throughout the design.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the webpage, ensuring semantic and accessible markup for both users and search engines.
CSS3: Used for styling the webpage, including layout, typography, colors, and other visual elements.
Flexbox & CSS Grid: These layout tools were employed to create a responsive and adaptive design, ensuring that content displays correctly across multiple devices.

Purpose:
This project serves both as a learning exercise and a portfolio piece to showcase my skills in front-end development. By recreating the Amazon homepage, I gained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
